        <p class="text1">Residing primarily in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans,
          the Green Turtle is often seen in the great barrier reef. Up to 60,000
          female green turtles congregate on the tiny Raine Island each nesting
          season. Other species can also be seen in the reef but not comonly due
          to the fact that all 7 species of marine turtles are listed as endangered.</p>

          and the great barrier reef. Dlphins such as the spinner dolphin may be
          seen playing in the waves all year but whales are usually only seen in
          the winter. One exception is the world-wide famous Migaloo, a full-grown
          white humpback and the only whale in the world to be totally white.</p>

          of 3000 individual reef systems, 760 fringe reefs, 600 tropical islands
          and about 300 coral cays. It is a network of marine sanctuaries of unparalleled
          ecological importance – a place where beauty transcends business,
          where nature reigns supreme. How much greater can you get?</p>

          <p class="fact">Billions of pounds of plastic can be found in swirling convergences that make up about 40
            percent of the world's ocean surfaces. Plastics pollution has a direct and deadly effect
            on wildlife and thousands of seabirds and sea turtles, seals and other marine mammals are
            killed each year after ingesting plastic or getting entangled in it.</p>

          <p class="fact">Overfishing occurs when more fish are caught than the population
            can reproduce. This causes a huge negative effect on the biodiversity of
            ocean animals. Over the past 40 years, 39% of marine species have decreased
            and it has a huge impact on the ocean's ecosystem.</p>

          <p class="fact">Sunlight is how corals get their oxygen,
            and due to climate change and deoxygenation 16% of the world's coral reefs have serious and lasting damage.
            The Great Barrier Reef has also experienced eight mass bleaching events since 1979, triggered by unusually high sea surface
            temperatures.</p>

          <p class="fact">Climate projections for the Reef show that the sea level is rising, the ocean is becoming more acidic,
            intense storms and rainfall will become more frequent, and ocean currents will change.
            These changes will have consequences for the biodiversity, our economy and coastlines because of the reefs importance.</p>
